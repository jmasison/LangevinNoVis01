     * I will use a variation of the secant method to determine r0 given kon. 
     * Newton's method frequently didn't converge because f is very flat for 
     * large r0 but has a huge derivative right near the zero of f-kon. Because
     * of this, the conventional secant method usually fails too.  Here I use 
     * a modified secant method.  Define g(r) = f(r) -kon. I choose two initial
     * points, r_left and r_right, such that g(r_left) > 0 and g(r_right) < 0 
     * (so I know the zero point lies between r_left and r_right). I then use 
     * the usual secant step to get
     * r_next = (r_left*g(r_right) - r_right*g(r_left))/(g(r_right) - g(r_left)).
     * I then check whether g(r_next) is either > 0 or <0,and assign it to either
     * r_left or r_right accordingly.  Usually only one of the two gets updated
     * during the entire iterative process, so to cut off the process we just
     * check the size of abs(g(r_next)) instead of the difference between
     * r_left and r_right. This method does not converge nearly as fast as 
     * Newton's method, but as I only call this function a few times in the very
     * beginning, speed isn't really an issue here.  More importantly, it's 
     * a very stable method for this function, which kind of looks like a 
     * Gaussian. 
     * 
     * THE METHOD INTERNALLY SOLVES FOR THE CORRECT r0, BUT IT THEN RETURNS
     * THE CORRECT lambda USING lambda = D/r0^2.

     * There are several inequalities which must be satisfied in order for 
     * my program to accurately simulate the physics I want to reproduce. This
     * function will check these inequalities and tell me if they are satisfied.
     * 
     * 1) The maximum possible on-rate is given by kon,max = 4*pi*R*D, so we'd
     * better have kon < 4*pi*R*D . If that isn't satisfied then nothing else
     * will work. 
     * 
     * 2) For testing purposes, I'd like to stay in the dilue concentration
     * limit.  That means that the volume occupied by the particles (really
     * the full volume contained in their reaction radii) should be much
     * less than the volume of the system.  The cutoff is somewhat arbitrary, 
     * but a safe threshold is probably V_particles < 0.0001 * V_system. 
     * 
     * 3) The root-mean-squared step distance should be much less than the 
     * smallest distance in the problem, either p or R-p.  
     * Noting rms = sqrt(2*D*dt), we would like 2*D*dt << (R-p)^2 . Exactly
     * how much less is not clear yet.  I thought I'd need 8*rms < (R-p), but 
     * that seems too restrictive. 
     * 
     * 4) Lastly, we'd better make sure that the probabilty of reacting during 
     * a given time step is much less than 1, that is, lambda*dt << 1.  
     * 
     * This method will take in p and R in nanometers, D in um^2/s, kon in
     * uM-1.s-1, and dt in seconds, and will check the status of each of these
     * inequalities.  We'll also need the particle number and system volume.
